Hello! I'm Estelle Lim

I am a 12-year-old student who loves to explore the world through books. Reading is one of my favorite activities - it allows me to travel to different worlds, learn new things, and experience amazing adventures through stories.

My passion for reading shows that I'm curious and eager to learn. Books are like windows to new knowledge and exciting possibilities!
