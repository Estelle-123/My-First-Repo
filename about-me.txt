👋 Hello! I'm Estelle Lim

I am a 12-year-old student who loves to explore the world through books 📚. Reading is one of my favorite activities - it allows me to travel to different worlds 🌎, learn new things, and experience amazing adventures through stories ✨.

My passion for reading shows that I'm curious and eager to learn 🤓. Books are like windows to new knowledge and exciting possibilities! 📖

My favorite colors are light purple 💜, blue 💙, and yellow 💛 - they remind me of beautiful sunsets and bright, cheerful days!
